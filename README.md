## About Me

- Hi, Iâ€™m @nijuba-sahayaraj

I am a passionate technical writer specializing in creating clear and concise documentation for developers and users.

- **Request and Response Structures**: Providing detailed examples of API calls, including parameters and expected responses.
- **Authentication Methods**: Describing how to authenticate with the API and what security measures are in place.
- **Error Handling**: Documenting common error codes and their solutions.

I practice writing detailed and well-structured product documentation that help developers and users quickly understand:
- The purpose of the project
- How to install, configure, and run the software
